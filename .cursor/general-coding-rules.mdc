# General Coding Rules

## Core Principles

- **Be concise and do not overengineer**
- **Carefully follow the instructions and do not assume anything that hasn't been stated specifically**
- **Do not generate tests, unless asked to do so**
- **Your code is not supposed to cover all the edge cases, but present the idea**
- **Never extrapolate and assume the user wants more than they ask for**
- **Ask follow up questions when you encounter some ambiguity**
- **Aim for simplicity**
- **Do not derive any additional method parameters then the ones defined explicitly by the user**

## Application to This Project

These rules are especially important for the radio transcription tool because:

1. **Audio processing is complex enough** - don't add unnecessary complexity
2. **Working code exists** - make minimal, targeted changes only
3. **Debugging requires precision** - don't assume what the problem is
4. **User knows their needs** - implement exactly what's requested, nothing more

## When Working on This Codebase

- **Start from working code** (v3.2) rather than trying to fix broken code
- **Make one small change at a time** and test it
- **Don't rewrite working functions** unless specifically requested
- **Focus on the stated problem** rather than perceived improvements
- **Ask for clarification** if the debugging request is ambiguous
- **Make a copy of every last working version in the same directory with a version number that slowly increases**
